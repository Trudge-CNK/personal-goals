Start date: 1/1/2021

Goal: I honestly hope to inspire other people to do their own versions of the 100XofX challenge.

1/30/2021: I'm going to cancel this todo since it doesn't really seem that important to me. Hopefully I'll have some social media presence in the future, but
            it's not a habit or goal that I think bears focusing on.
