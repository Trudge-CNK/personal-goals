Start Date: 1/3/2021

Reason: Same as with Reddit. I had to keep myself accountable for how many hours I was wasting compared to how many hours
I was working on my actual goals.

1/?/2021:   10 Hours of Youtube
1/20/2021:  20 Hours of Youtube
1/25/2021:  I didn't really like how my youtube consumption was going, so I tried to limit it on my phone at least by using screenwise.
1/29/2021:  30 Hours of Youtube
1/30/2021:  I think I'm going to change things so I only have to update this once a week. Updating every day just seems needlessly tedious.

I actually messed up while keeping track of this so I'm just going to cancel it. I have made some better habits around youtube such as only watching it in 15-minute
bursts. I also try to watch episodic shows while having lunch so I don't fall into a youtube or tv rabbit hole.
