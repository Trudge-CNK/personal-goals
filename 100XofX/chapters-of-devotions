I might share my daily notes somewhere here later
Goal: Make devotions that I can share with others a consistent habit.
Start date: 1/1/2021

1/11/2021:  Finished 2 Corinthians.
            Reached 10% of my goal
1/17/2021:  Finished Galatians
1/21/2021:  Reached 20% of my goal
1/30/2021: I still want to keep track of this, but I think I'm just going to focus on how many books I've completed and how I can improve my devotional life
            as a Christian. I really don't care too much if I announce each time I finish reading 10 chapters.
1/30/2021: I decided to focus on finding something to meditate on throughout the day or finding something to have as a talking point during devotions. If I'm
            never sharing what I'm learning. I'll never actually grow my own perspective.
