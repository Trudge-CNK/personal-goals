Reason: I just want something simple so I can push to 100. I'd like to know I've done something with the day

Start date: 1/12/2021

At some point, I changed it to alternating between todos and my other goals because I was trying too hard to do todos.

1/17/2020: I'm changing it back to 100 todos because I've had a bunch of todos pile up now that I'm back at my normal residence where I can actually perform most
            my outstanding todos.
1/18/2020: 10 Todos
            Like, I was saying, with me being back at my home base, there are tons of small todos that I can work on quickly.
1/19/2020: 20 Todos
            I still have just a bunch of small todos available. I think it should slow down a bit after these 10.
