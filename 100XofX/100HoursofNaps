Start Date: 1/4/2021

Reason: Same reason as with Reddit and Youtube. I've built up a huge habit of resting my mind whenever possible so I
reflexively switched to napping like crazy when I didn't have the open options of Reddit and Youtube.


Cancelled: Honestly it was just something that was hard to keep track of. If I didn't start out the nap with a planned end, I didn't really have a good sense of
how much time to add onto my timer.
