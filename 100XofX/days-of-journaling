Start date: 1/1/2021
Just a recap of the day in daily-thoughts
It'll be nice to go back at the end of the year to see what I ended up doing
I might also do weekly, monthly, quarterly updates as well.


1/30/2021: I'm still going to try to keep journaling most days, but I don't really care if I announce how I'm doing with my journaling habit every time I do
            10 days of journaling.
