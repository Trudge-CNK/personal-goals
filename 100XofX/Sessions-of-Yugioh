Start date: 1/1/2021
Goal:   Get into the King of Games Tournament in my Discord Progression Series server
        See what ranking I can get in Yugioh simulators for Goat format
        See if I'd want to climb the ladder in any other card games
        Decide on my future in trading card games overall

10 Hours in: I'm getting a feel for how real players think through their game, but I'm really missing out on actually playing the game. I feel like it's hard to
make good notes on match commentary, which hurt my flashcards a lot.

Currently at 21 Sessions.Aiming for 33 Sessions total since I don't plan on being all that great at Yugioh.
