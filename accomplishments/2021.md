  **Social Circle** (worse)
  I solidified my Yugioh Progression Discord with the rules
    1. play once per set unless I'm excited for more
    2. unless I'm doing well enough to participate in the King of Games tournament
**Improving**  (just different)
finished working on Crash Team Racing Nitro Refueled
dropped TEFL for a while in order to work on tech certifications
dropped free code camp since I never really started it
**Exercise** (worse)
I actually dropped all exercise since I started having a busier work schedule
