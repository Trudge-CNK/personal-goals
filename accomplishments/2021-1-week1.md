This Week's Focus:
I want my main focus to be on the hourly challenges since I can burn through them more quickly than the others, which require an entire day to get to a count of 1.
Review: It did not go well. I have maybe 5 hours in one of my categories that aren't my "pacemaker" categories of reddit and youtube.

Things I'll do This Week:
 Work through 2 Corinthians
 Start making personal posts on twitter instead of just liking posts
 Work on updating this personal-goals page to be more filled out as my daily journal
 Work towards finishing Learning How to Learn from Coursera.
 Learn as much as I can about the Goat format in Yugioh
 Work through all the N. Trophy times on CTR.
Things I'll Do in the Future:
Work through Galatians
Work through Mindshift on Coursera
Review my own Yugioh matches
Work through all the Oxide times on CTR
