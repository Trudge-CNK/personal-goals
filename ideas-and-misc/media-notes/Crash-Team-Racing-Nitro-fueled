Crash Nitro Refueled Notes

From last time I played
    • Classic mode was really hard. My clearest example was that I had to double triple boost to win against Pinstripe on his boss track
    • Overall, it was very nostalgic and had a lot of options to make the experience really classic or fairly new. An old graphics slider would have been the coup de resistance
    • It was pretty quick to beat the main game, although I only finished like 38% of the game according to the save

This time
1st session
    • I’m playing medium difficulty on the new standard mode. I chose this because I want to have the flexibility to change to any driver or driving style as I approach the hardest challenges the game has to offer. I felt that if I always had to be Panda, I would lag behind if it was a track that didn’t offer many chances to slide-boost
    • I think the boss fight was actually a lot easier than the standard tracks because it takes a lot of the random missiles and other items away.
    • It is faithfully recreated. Aku giving you a new tip every time you win towards the beginning seems so old-school when it could otherwise be put into an interactive tutorial or just a notebook somewhere.
    • It feels really strange to race against all the other people because they’re using all the crazy skins and whatnot while I’m just regular old Pura.
    • You can really tell that Naughty Dog wanted to get out of this series. The entire plot is screaming, “Please hate this! It’s a random alien who wants the planet to be a parking lot!” while the game play totally makes up for it.
    • The opening box where all the racers comes out seems quite tame compared to the opening I remember from the PS1
2
    • Medium is a fairly hard difficulty. I think they just cranked up the difficulty on this game all around
    • I tried to change to crach, a balanced type, but I couldn’t get used to not being able to triple boost almost whenever I pleased
    • I started unlocking characters from the shop, which is kind of  a gimmicky thing. Eventually, you can buy all the characters, but it requires a lot of grinding. All the original characters require beating all the content the game has to offer which I find a lot more compelling.

    • So I was wrong with going with the turn characters. Instead of doing a ground brake turn, you can do one in the air so it makes all the faster characters super viable. I switched to Acceleration as my driving style, and I’ve been able to catch up a lot better than before in races rather than having to drift like mad just to stay inches ahead.
    • I think it’s super weird that and Arabian-themed lizard is the boss of the snow section.
    • It’s kind of a weird move that each door has multiple locks instead of just having a different lock that each boss gives you one specific key for. I wonder if it was to save space on models in the original game?
    • I still need to master the air brake though. Pinstripe was having a field day with me.
4
    • Okay so Oxide was a total pushover for some reason.
    • The story is so beautifully lazy. Oxide is just like, ok well I lost, but I’m gonna stick around just because…
    • The relic races seem like an interesting challenge. At least you don’t have to get gold or platinum relics for 100%. 
    • The CTR tokens don’t seem to be that hard, but I’m also only racing on the first world so far where all the other competitors are idiots.
    • I’m curious if the original credits had different endings for the characters since a lot of the new ones reference Tai-bo or things like streaming. i.e. they’re obviously updated.
    • I do love that the animation is so stretchy. That’s one thing that died over time in the ratchet and clank games. Somehow everyone became plastic after being so expressive in the PS2 games.
    • I will say after playing so many games where it’s either story-based or you can’t really tell what your character’s health is, it’s nice having a game where you can almost viscerally feel the second place racer breathing down your neck. I haven’t had that much action since like nuclear throne?
    • I will say that it’s nice to go back to the older courses with your skills from the end game so you can crush the competition while going out of the way to grab ctr tokens
    • I think the arena’s and relic races are pretty balanced so that you don’t even have to be that fast, you just have to be very accurate
-
    • It’s a good little villain nod that Oxide cheats of the starting gate
    • The second race with oxide is nuts with all the beakers you have to wade through. Fortunately, he’s not actually all that fast.
    • The CTR races weren’t too bad to get through. They just required figuring out where the heck the letters were
    • The relic races were really easy, especially for just getting blue. They were designed around going through the track really precisely, not actually all that fast.
    • In the end, Oxide just warps back home. The whole story is so simple and random. I am glad the developers focused on making it a fun racer rather than attaching a huge story mode though.
    • I did end getting second in one of the races in the purple gem cup, but I still won so I guess that’s fine.


Other things to do
    1. Complete all CTR races
    2. Beat all Gem Cups
    3. Get all Blue relics
    4. Beat Oxide a second time
    5. Get all Gold relics
    6. Get all Platinum relics
    7. Beat N Trophy’s time trials
    8. Figure out the Golden Egg and Mystery Door
    9. Get all the characters from the Shop?
    10. Beat Oxide’s time trials
    11. Get all the stars in arcade mode.

Thoughts after 33 Hours
    • It was really refreshing to see myself improve at something. Every time I looped around to a track, I assumed I was at my best run, but somehow I kept keeping the blue fire and kept cutting the corners better. I didn’t manage to beat all of the Velo trials, but I’m pretty sure I could have if I had kept at it.
    • I might have had a chance at the dev trials, but that just seems like torture to me.
    • There’s no way I’m taking any of the world records unless I dedicate a crazy amount of time to one track.
    • Final thoughts: Other than as a proof of concept, I kinda didn’t like getting better at CTR. I don’t have any friends that are into the game so I can’t race them. The online is dead so I can’t even be part of a friend group in that way. It’s a skill that is utterly useless in the real world. I won’t say I wasted my time because it was fun, and I finally proved that I can get better at something slowly. 
    • I did end up finally finding a lobby in the online mode (I guess the trick was to try in the afternoon on the weekends). It was actually pretty fun always being in the top ~4 in any given lobby. As much as I liked almost winning, I can’t really waste a lot of free time by playing too much of this. I’ll definitely have to see if Cole still plays a lot of Mario Kart or if I can convince people from my small group to play Crash as well.

Outside Studies
    • Apparently Crash inhales a butterfly in the opening movie and only spits it out after the second match with oxide.
    • It kinda sucks that they had all those grand prix events that only happened once. I guess that’s the curse of online game modes…
    • Wow, there are a lot of fans stating random facts about this game. The TV tropes pages are huge. Unfortunately, since the game is pretty light on plot, I wasn’t super interested in a lot of the factoids.
