Episode 1
    • That was a heck of a start. She takes baths in the pitch dark, sleeps with random guys, and is addicted to pills. She still makes it to her chess match, though.
    • She had a heck of a childhood. I wonder what went on with her mathematician mother that she started running from the Dad. Was he actually abusive. Did the mother just have a psychotic break?
    • “Close your eyes” It was a miracle she survived, but I’ve never had to think about the orphanage system in the US. I wonder how accurate any of it is?
    • I actually really like the young actress. She has this really detached energy, but it’s also super believable as to how a 9 year old would talk. Good job for her.
    • I was glad to see that she found something she could be passionate about. The janitor was skeptical at first, but she played every night in her head. I guess the drugs helped her visualize a bit, but I hope that she wouldn’t be worse if she was off the drugs.
    • Was it standard for kids to get drugged in orphanages in the ~50s?
    • She’s gifted all right. I don’t envy any of her surroundings, but there’s something beautiful about that 100% focus on one hobby. I would pray for that sort of dedication for any of my kids. Maybe I should try to live a bit more like that?
    • I can’t believe part of joining the orphanage is burning your old clothes and changing your hair cut. My goodness.
    • Jolene is a fun character. She’s rambunctious and breaks the rules a bit, but she’s actually pretty perceptive about the drugs and how much she can get away with. Beth got wrecked by the pills, but Jolene seems just fine.
    • That was awkward seeing Beth see normal people. She destroyed them in chess, but the scene showed how out of place she was among chess players and the general public.
    • Beth is smart, but her genius is really focused on chess. She came up with a decent plan for stealing the drugs, but it wasn’t an amazing one by any means.
    • The music choice for the final scene was intense. She reached her “Hallelujah, but it wasn’t the heavens of the movie, it was the tranquilizers” It was really dissonant, and it worked.
    • I can’t believe the drugs were so powerful she burnt her hand on the radiator and didn’t care about it.
    • This episode was such a cliff hanger that I had to immediately watch the second. Unfortunately, there wasn’t too much fallout that was interesting.
Episode 2
    • I didn’t totally buy the transition from child to the adult actress. People do become more expressive as they get older, but I guess the time skip kinda hit weird. The adult actress does keep the character odd and reserved, though.
    • I can’t really believe she got adopted but hey. Poor Jolene.
    • I can’t believe she got banned from all chess and fun just for that one incident. Nowadays, that’s a cry for help. Back then, it was reason to be exiled?
    • I guess the janitor just kinda had to go along with everything. I was so glad to hear that he fronted her the $5 for the entrance fee.
    • Good thing the other girl at the tournament told her all the tournament-specific rules. That could have turned out bad.
    • Why did Mr. Wheatley adopt a child if he was just going to divorce his wife or, at the very least, leave her high and dry?
    • That poor lady. Her dreams are crushed, and she doesn’t have any way out. No wonder she sees Beth as a money machine. At least someone appreciates her ability in some form. 
    • That was a weird bit where Beth was staring at the couple making out. Possibly weirder that the couple didn’t care they were being stared at.
    • That’s such a shame that she found the drugs again through her depressed adoptive Mom
    • Beth has a big problem with mind games. She got distracted by the one guy, but that was because she has the hots for him. Comb guy really through her off, and Beltik threw her off because of his tardiness in addition to his constant yawning.
    • I was hoping she could beat him normally, but she had to take the drugs to calm down enough to focus. I really hope she gets out of the addiction at some point. Will being clean ruin her chess career?
    • That was intense to see her full-focused after the drugs though. 
    • Poor girl beat all the other people in the tournament while on her period.
    • The color palette is really into greens and yellows, but her entire room is pink. The ~70s house is striking.
    • I’m surprised at the difference between this and something like Hikaru no go. It’s really American to zoom in on someone spectacular. Even though Beth has absolutely nothing going for her training wise, she’s been born naturally gifted enough to win the state chess tournament. Hikaru, even though he has the help of an ancient go master, has to slowly work and study his way up the ladder until he joins the lower ranks of the pros.
Episode 3
    • The flashback with the Mom was weird. All I can say is my goodness can that woman hold her breath. That was a long swim.
    • I like that they showed off in her wardrobe that she managed to get the “right” shoes and silhouette. It was also nice to see her wear the same dress but a different shirt. It makes everything just a little bit realistic. The poor first guy she faced that just said, “Aww Shit.” was great.
    • That’s good to shower her trying to learn Russian, etc. as a plan for her future.
    • I like that with Benny Watt’s she finally faced a similar prodigy for the game. I wonder if it made her regret that she had to discover the game at 9 when he started becoming famous at that age.
    • The interview was awkward with the press. She tried to push Beth for revealing answers when there were none, and she tried to insinuate that Beth must have some sort of mental illness to be as good at chess as she was. It was actually the one point where I was kinda proud of the mother.
    • I was surprised that Beth actually got invited to one of the social clubs just through being good at chess. It didn’t last, and it gave her an opportunity to get alcohol in addition to her drugs, but it have a chance to show that she doesn’t fit in with the normal world even when her accomplishments allow her to.
    • That was nice of Beth to give her Mom a 15% managers fee. Of course, without the Mom, Beth would have to be trapped in an orphanage.
    • The time skip was nice for letting everyone know that her “prodigy” coat has gone. She’s still really good an an enigma for being a woman, but now she’s just another adult player.
    • That’s unfortunate that Townes is gay. He seemed like the only man she ever really responded to. I wonder how she gets to the point that she’s just banging random dudes in Europe?
    • I also feel like Townes falls into the trope of all the good-looking men being gay.
    • I’m not sure if the Vegas intro scene was as impressive as they had it in their heads. The music really set the mood but just having a character walk through a hotel lobby wasn’t that great.
    • I was actually impressed that the Mom let Beth turn down the TV volume so that she could replay her games. It shows that she knows it’s important for Beth to practice even if she doesn’t understand chess.
    • That was a killer headgame when Watts told Beth the mistake she made in her old game with Beltik. Beth kind of always assumed she’d just beat everyone.
    • Beth was prideful. She knew she could find errors in other players games(Morphy), but she never thought it would happen to her.
    • I liked the visualization that the players can go through many moves in their head at the beginning, and, after that, they can play fast because there’s only a few optimal paths through the game until the opening is over.
    • It’s cool that Beth in comfortable enough with her Mom that she’d complain about the game to her even if the Mom doesn’t understand.
    • Beth was playing to win no matter what, but all Benny had to play for was a draw. She still hasn’t lost, but I’m glad she actually got dealt a draw at least.
    • Beth was fiery, just saying how of course her Mom knows what it’s like to lose. The Mom didn’t lose there though, she just reiterated that now Beth knew what being a loser was like too.
    • Beth seemed crushed by Townes being gay with that abrupt goodbye. I really liked the callback to earlier in the episode though. At one point, the Mom holds Beth’s hand for comfort since Beth is their meal ticket. Now that Beth’s having some trouble, she reaches out for the Mom’s hand for some reassurance. It was nice way to end the episode.
    • The part where there were shadows all over her face when doing the drugs and alcohol was weird. Was she not able to practice chess as well with the alcohol in her system?
Episode 4
    • I’m not sure what to think of this episode. There was a lot going on.
    • On one hand, there was a struggle for Beth figuring out who she is outside of chess. The other part was a reveal that all gifts have some sort of counterbalance.
    • This girl can get some., although the college guy was a creep for sleeping with a highschooler.
    • The penis candle was hilarious.
    • It was refreshing to see Beth in something other than prim and proper clothes. It was weird to see her free when she got to stay at that random house for a few days.
    • The girl loves her drink though and the Russians know it. They’re sending out feelers for how to crush her best.
    • I was glad Mrs. Wheatley at least got some fun before she passed, but following her passion led to her dying. Does that lead to the question of what happens when Beth or any of us follow what truly makes us happy rather than what makes sense?
    • I was glad that Beth had a tranquil way to relax by using the pool rather than using drugs or drinking. I mean she even added pot this episode. The girl seems to find every drug known to man at ludicrously young ages.
    • I can’t quite peg Shaibel. I’m not sure if I believe he would actually give her that advice, but where else would it come from with the story we have so far?
    • The bits with the Russian kid were kind of cool. It seemed to be her first time playing an actual prodigy as well. She seemed taken aback that a child could make her play for 5 hours straight.
    • I really didn’t like that she was resorting to mind games to force the kid to make mistakes. It kind of indicates that she’s reaching the end of her natural skills and finding her wall.
    • Her reaching out to the kid, hoping that he’d be able to do more with his life than chess was sweet though.
    • She was so destroyed by her loss to Borghov that she just talked until she was finished, never noticing her Mom was dead.
    • Borghov used his experience to trap her in a strange game state. He didn’t have to be creative, didn’t have to finesse. He knew the game state he made, and there was no way out.
    • They kind of hinted that he’d win because he was white. “When chess is solved by computers, white will always win because of the first turn advantage.
    • Mr. Wheatley is more of a douchebag than you’d even imagine. He just trusts a 17 year old (that he doesn’t even remember) with burying his wife.
    • That’s a really bad sign that Beth found that you can buy her drugs without a prescription down in Mexico. 
    • With the hinting in this episode, are they leading us to a really depressing end where Beth is deposed from chess, and ends up alone with her addiction?
    • What will Beth do now that she’s actually had a loss against a Russian machine? She’s amazing, but she does play with passion.
    • As worthless as Mrs. Wheatley was sometimes, what will her passing drive Beth to do?
Episode 5
    • Her birth Mom must have been in a really bad situation or be really depressed for her to be telling her 8? year old daughter that one day she’ll be all alone. The start of the episode made it seem like her birth mom was right, but this episode was all about how people keep coming out of the woodwork to help her.
    • The shot of her mother’s piano and her mom’s lipstick on the cup were really poignant.
    • She couldn’t go to bed alone. It would be a quiet and scary house all by yourself.
    • Her “relationship” with Beltik had so many layers. He wanted to be with her so bad that he had his teeth fixed. He was doing his best to train her to actually study instead of just using intuition, but he also was trying to impress her as much as he could. I’m not really sure what she wanted. It seemed like she just needed someone harmless to live with her after her mom’s death and Beltik fit the bill.
    • That’s terrifying to know that she plays on pure intuition and doesn’t really have any plans in the endgame.
    • The sandwiches she made for her and Beltik looked so normal. It was kind of great.
    • I’m not exactly sure what her meeting with Margaret from highschool was about. I mean the other girl was an alcoholic too, but I’m not sure about the connection there.
    • I guess the pharmacist has been letting her steal chess reviews for years? That’s actually weirdly nice of him.
    • I guess Beltik cooled a lot after sex. Maybe he just realized that Beth wouldn’t ever love anything except for chess.
    • Beltik realized he didn’t actually love chess like a grandmaster does. He also just couldn’t teach Beth other than through pre-played games. She was way to sharp for him. After finding the pills, He eventually went through a whole speech about how she’s going to be the next Morphy. She’s brilliant, but if she keeps to only chess and abusing substances, she’ll burn out at a really young age/go crazy.
    • That’s terrible that Beth doesn’t remember any of her opponents’ faces.
    • The whole music montage for the chess tournament was good but also hilarious.
    • That was creepy that they put Beth in a men’s dorm because all the other players happened to be guys. At least that’s how it came off. Maybe she actually did it with one of them to blow off steam?
    • Watts is dang good at speed chess. I was surprised she recovered after losing so much. I couldn’t tell, was she just tricking him? She seemed kind of happy after the speed chess even though she lost every dollar she had on her. 
    • It was kind of creepy but kind of heartwarming that she sleeps with her Mom’s coat. 
    • Watt’s is a bit of a showman, looking for reporters, hawking his book, bragging about how “in-shape” he is compared to the average chess enthusiast. 
    • How was the question of the knife relevant? Was it to show that, at his core, Watt’s wasn’t as confident as he was saying, that he actually is afraid of some things. Beth, on the other hand, isn’t worried about danger, she just confidently goes ahead.
    • When Watt’s is saying how much of a drunk you are, you know it’s getting pretty obvious to people.
    • I did like the scenes where Beth was reading Watt’s book. She learned how to study well and was making sure to take him seriously.
    • I was surprised how fast Watt’s turned down sex. He isn’t some innocent little puppy like Beltik. It also showed how closed off and through-the-grapevine the chess world is. Somehow word got out about Beltik training Beth.
Episode 6
    • That’s crazy how much Beth holds onto what her Mom said. Her Mom’s advice to never listen to a man destroyed her this episode even though whenever she listens to a good-natured man, her chess and life improve.
    • I liked the fakeout with New York. It’s supposed to be this amazing city with a skyline, but Benny can only afford a crappy basement apartment. It’s such a bachelor pad too. The thing is disgusting compared to how much he is proud of himself.
    • It was amazing to see her just trounce everyone in speed chess once she’d actually trained in areas she was weak in.
    • Beth still doesn’t really have any sense of who she is. Cleo’s description of how all models are empty was really harsh, but I think that Beth kind of liked it because she’s empty herself. Just because she has a natural talent, people think she’s actually a good or focused person.
    • Beth doesn’t just like alcohol. She’s a full-blown alcoholic. As soon as she took that one drink with Chloe, she spiraled into a night of passion with Chloe (that was actually a neat reveal after the in-media-res opening where you assumed it was a guy) and started taking her tranquilizers again. I was glad for the plot that she lost her rematch with Borghov. She really didn’t deserve it after falling like that.
    • That was actually cool to see that Benny had sex with her since he was so impressed by her skills. He didn’t really see it until she destroyed him in chess. He also apparently is decent in the bed compared to everyone else. He’s really insensitive though, using chess as pillowtalk? No wonder Beth wanted to see what it was like with a woman.
    • Benny wanted her to come back to New York, but all she wanted to do was be alone. 
    • Her Dad is such a douche bag. He forced his daughter to buy her own house, reneging on his promise that she could have it. The only deal he let her strike was that she could subtract off her mother’s burial price.
    • She wasn’t worthless, she was just stuck. Did you ever even listen to her play?
    • That was brutal that she met her Dad in her Mom’s old housecoat. Did the guy even recognize?
    • As long as Beth has something to do, she’s seems pretty healthy. The entire time she was getting the house ready, she was completely sober and was chugging along. As soon as she finished and got bored with life, she relapsed.
    • It’s so awful seeing the people around her try to help her. Beltik and Benny can’t really help her in chess, but they do know what she needs to be stable.
    • She and the sorority girl from high school both buy crap tons of liquor. It doesn’t matter what your passion is, or whether you got stuck in life, you still have your demons.
    • The tut, tut, tut song sounded so bad because it sounded less like tut, tut, tut, and more like der, der, der.
    • She’s so bad she can barely even make it to her chess tournaments.
    • Beltik finally had a chance to talk to her since he knows the signs of alcoholism, but he can’t get through. He seems to be living a decent life doing college part time and doing a good job as the manager of the grocery store.
    • Having Jolene come back out of nowhere is quite the development. I wonder what sort of advice she’ll have that will get through to Beth because Beth really needs something to fight for since chess isn’t the rock that it once was. 
    • Once Beth loses chess, she can’t control anything. She’s back in the real world with everyone else.
    • It is cool that Beth is so skilled at chess but also has a taste for fashion and the like. Like I saw mentioned on reddit, we’re finally getting to a point where a female protagonist can be strong and feminine, not just some crazy ninja warrior.
Episode 7
    • The Mom couldn’t afford Harmon and the Dad already had a whole other life set up so the Mom purposefully killed herself so Harmon could be taken in by the state.
    • Methuen is tough. “You are here because your parents made certain mistakes and we are here to make sure you don’t make the same ones”
    • Deardorf seemed far gone, but it was scary that Harmon still responded to her as if she was a student. That place was really traumatizing for her.
    • I really liked what they did with Jolene. She’s becoming very successful, but she’s still doing everything she can do to screw over authority and power. She’s just doing it in a smarter way by high-jacking privilege and making her way through law school to access education and power.
    • People keep Harmon from drink. If Jolene wasn’t there, she’d have a bottle of wine.
    • Mr. Shaibel was so key to her development, but no one even really showed up to his funeral.
    • Even though she never paid back the $10, Shaibel followed every one of Harmon’s exploits. She wasn’t alone.
    • Harmon had been avoiding all the press junkets and tournaments so she didn’t have any money. She tried Benny, but he flat out rejected her after she told him she’d rather just be a drunk. Jolene was there, not as a guardian angel, as her family to help her get to Moscow.
    • Harmon flat out refused to do anything with Christian crusade after what Harmon’s life is like. She also just is always really true to herself no matter where that lands her. She won’t put on a fake front for anything.
    • Moscow was stark. It had really fancy chess furnishings, but it was also just really imposing. The architecture of a lot of the buildings in landscape shots was beautiful though.
    • I liked that even though she got rid of the pills, she immediately called the front desk to ask if she could get a prescription for more. It’s a bit more realistic that way.
    • Her match with the older Russian was sweet. She admired his games a lot, and he said that she was probably the best he’d ever played.
    • After the adjournment with the older Russian, we got to see the Russians using teamwork first hand. Borghov was glad to help out the older Russian. At this point, all Harmon could do was plan all night by herself.
    • I guess Townes was a nice touch just to bring back that all these people in her life are there to support her. It also probably let her relax. She did get the proper vibes from Townes, it’s just that she was so amazing at chess that he tried to not be gay for a second for her.
    • It was a really nice moment when Benny and everyone else called. The Americans may be individualistic, but they’ll join together to kick Russian butt.
    • The moment where he eyes wandered up to the ceiling was amazing. She always assumed her visualization was due to the drugs, but he chess skills were hers all along. It just took her taking care of herself and having some actual loving support that let her see all the moves she needed to make.
    • Borghov was a good sport at losing, unlike Harmon.
    • Instead of going back to the US and doing a whole tour being a puppet with rah rah USA talking points, Harmon decided to wander around Russia to play with some of the regular people. I feel like it echoed her times with Shaibel, when playing with an old man was the only fun she had in life.
Quick final thoughts
    • I feel like it wrapped up too nicely. She just kinda realized the power of friends and family and then went on to be world champion. Either that, or I want to spend more time with her when she’s actually a stable human being, but maybe that’s not the interesting part of her story.
    • I liked that Harmon was troubled and steely but also unabashedly feminine.
    • I guess I have to consider though that she, from a young age, knew that anyone who was close to her would kill themselves to be rid of her as a burden.
    • Rating: 7/10?
Extra research
    • Benny needs his knife because he lives in such a crappy apartment
    • Beth is so into clothes because she never had them in the orphanage and she gets bullied instantly the moment she goes out into the real world with her Methuen outfit
    • I did remember that Mr. Wheatley was the one that wanted Beth, but it was Alma saying it. It seems that Mr. Wheatley was so annoyed with his wife that he thought buying a child would be the answer to his woes.
    • That’s pretty impressive. Most of the cast is British
    • Little Man Tate is a book about a prodigy by the same author
    • the ceiling chess board always copies Mr. Shaibel’s
    • There’s a fan theory that Cleo is a KGB agent there to sabotage Beth
    • There’s a meme where Beth plays a bunch of standard board games
    • Benny refused sex with Beth when she was drunk, but after they trained for a while and she stayed sober, he was fine with it.
    • Tv tropes mentioned that Borghov only ever really said good things about Beth. He mainly focused on the game instead of any political theater and wanted to face the best.
