### This Week's Focus:
I want my main focus to be on the hourly challenges since I can burn through them more quickly than the others, which
require an entire day to get to a count of 1.

### Things I'll do This Week:
1. Work through 2 Corinthians
2. Start making personal posts on twitter instead of just liking posts
3. Work on updating this personal-goals page to be more filled out as my daily journal
4. Work towards finishing Learning How to Learn from Coursera.
5. Learn as much as I can about the Goat format in Yugioh
6. Work through all the N. Trophy times on CTR.

### Things I'll Do in the Future:
1. Work through Galatians
2. Work through Mindshift on Coursera
3. Review my own Yugioh matches
4. Work through all the Oxide times on CTR
