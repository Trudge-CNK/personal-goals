### This Week's Focus:
I want my main focus to be on the hourly challenges since I can burn through them more quickly than the others, which
require an entire day to get to a count of 1.

### Things I'll do This Week:
- [ ] Work through Galatians
- [ ] Be able to make ~10 hour update posts on twitter
- [ ] Work towards finishing Learning How to Learn from Coursera.
- [ ] Learn as much as I can about the Goat format in Yugioh
- [ ] Work through all the N. Trophy times on CTR.

### Things I'll Do in the Future:
1. Work through Ephesians
2. Work through Mindshift on Coursera
3. Find professionally reviewd Yugioh matches
4. Work through all the Oxide times on CTR
