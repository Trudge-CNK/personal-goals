This is a weird thought, but I was thinking about the methodological naturalism that you kind of have to employ when working in a lab. Even if you believe in the possibility of miracles as a Christian, you have to forgo that a bit in order to get reproducible scientific results. I think I might have to do a version of that for my own life. Even though a lot of people are motivated to live better because of their Christian faith, my faith tends to bring me a lot of depression and listlessness because I don't feel worthy to be counted among the saints. I also tend to feel like this life doesn't matter a whole bunch because 1. I'll live forever anyway and 2. I don't have to worry about the direction of my life because God has a plan for me. Under a daily methodological naturalism though, I only have one shot at life. It's actually frustrating that I haven't achieved much of anything at the age of 30. I actually need to press on towards goals and skills because there's not a perfect vocation for me waiting in heaven. It's a weird approach, but I think it's one I want to test out to see how well it works.

Today was fine, but unproductive. I forgot some important things for work so I ended up having to retrace a lot of my steps, leading to a ridiculously long work day. I had a tiny bit of time in the afternoon/evening, but I also had to fit in an online Good Friday service (can't wait to get the vaccine). I was left with precious little time so I had a day that was responsible but overwhelmingly average.

I had a pretty crappy day. Work went absolutely fine except for my dog trying to kill himself by running near a super busy 4 lane road and giving me a panic attack. My Mom had an emergency at work so I ended up watching the puppy for longer than I expected. After that, I went to my tried and true absolute waste of an afternoon. I think I'm going to try to use an empty room in the house as a safe space to get away from technology. I can either safely nap there or just meditate so that I can just reset myself for the rest of the day.

I had 2 full days off, but I managed to throw them into the toilet. I can't be sure, but I really do think I'm most motivated by how short life is. As a Christian, I was moved by Easter and a faith-based podcast suggested that we should be excited to serve for our loving Lord, but somehow I always end up focusing on how short this crappy life is compared to utter joy in heaven. I'll have to test it out, but living as if this is my only chance to do things seems to be the most pragmatic way for me to live.

This day went pretty well. I managed to do 3 of the 4 major things I planned in the day. I studied in the morning, I studied Japanese while driving around, and I managed to reset my day pretty well by having a moment without tech. The only thing I didn't get to was having a study session in the afternoon, but I'm kind of ok with that since I got a good number of todos done. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up the momentum by focusing on this being the only life I get.

I fell off the wagon there for a couple days. The main culprit this time was me trying to be too fancy with my sleep schedule. I work best in the mornings so I was waking up at crazy times. I did manage to learn things in the morning so that part was working well. The main problem was that I would then crash in the afternoon when I wanted to study some more. I would take multiple hour naps near when I wanted to fall asleep. The excessive naps led to me not being able to fall alseep when I wanted to, leaving me even more tired the next day. It got so bad that I just felt like a complete zombie the one day. I've worked the day around so I have a sleep schedule built around 90 minute sleep cycles. I'm also taking a bit of caffeine more wisely so I don't crash so hard. Finally, I am alternating how early I wake up so I don't have too much sleep debt.
