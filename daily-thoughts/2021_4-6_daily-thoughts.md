This is a weird thought, but I was thinking about the methodological naturalism that you kind of have to employ when working in a lab. Even if you believe in the possibility of miracles as a Christian, you have to forgo that a bit in order to get reproducible scientific results. I think I might have to do a version of that for my own life. Even though a lot of people are motivated to live better because of their Christian faith, my faith tends to bring me a lot of depression and listlessness because I don't feel worthy to be counted among the saints. I also tend to feel like this life doesn't matter a whole bunch because 1. I'll live forever anyway and 2. I don't have to worry about the direction of my life because God has a plan for me. Under a daily methodological naturalism though, I only have one shot at life. It's actually frustrating that I haven't achieved much of anything at the age of 30. I actually need to press on towards goals and skills because there's not a perfect vocation for me waiting in heaven. It's a weird approach, but I think it's one I want to test out to see how well it works.

Today was fine, but unproductive. I forgot some important things for work so I ended up having to retrace a lot of my steps, leading to a ridiculously long work day. I had a tiny bit of time in the afternoon/evening, but I also had to fit in an online Good Friday service (can't wait to get the vaccine). I was left with precious little time so I had a day that was responsible but overwhelmingly average.

I had a pretty crappy day. Work went absolutely fine except for my dog trying to kill himself by running near a super busy 4 lane road and giving me a panic attack. My Mom had an emergency at work so I ended up watching the puppy for longer than I expected. After that, I went to my tried and true absolute waste of an afternoon. I think I'm going to try to use an empty room in the house as a safe space to get away from technology. I can either safely nap there or just meditate so that I can just reset myself for the rest of the day.
