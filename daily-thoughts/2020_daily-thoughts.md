I unintentionally stressed myself out a little by how I arranged my reward structure. I wanted to do either 1:1 or 1:2 work to play ratio according to time, but 1:2 seemed to easy. I changed everything to 1:1, but that made me stress out everytime I used my time to take a break, which led to me just throwing the rules away instead of working with them. Instead of making everything time-bound, I'm going to keep the same ratios, and I'm going to instead focus everything on tasks rather than time.
I also ended up wasting a good bit of time because I havent' figured out how to spend time properly with the puppy. I was planning on tiring him out, but instead he napped on me for like 3 hours which killed my entire morning. Which, of course, lead to the death of the entire rest of the day.

Not a whole bunch to say. I ended up not being able to make a solid transition between work and home (possiby because I wanted to watch the puppy?). Without a smooth transition, I just ended up not really accomplishing anything.

Using task based 1:1 work:play ratios worked pretty well, but I have to be watching that I don't overextend in play so I had to make a list of what counted as a work session vs a play session. I also ended up adding a rule that I should always have an alarm for naps since I took a nap that wasted a good chunk of the afternoon. I was able to keep to pretty much all my smaller todos, but the lost time from the nap killed any chances at larger projects.

I got a good workout since I had to kayak a lot at work, but we ended up messing up so we'll have to have another huge kayak day later. I took a whole bunch of long naps throughout the day and even ended up sleeping somehwere that wasn't my room for the night. I did end up keeping myself to my work:play ratios, but I was kind of running thin on what I counted as work by the end of the day.
