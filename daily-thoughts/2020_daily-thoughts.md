I unintentionally stressed myself out a little by how I arranged my reward structure. I wanted to do either 1:1 or 1:2 work to play ratio according to time, but 1:2 seemed to easy. I changed everything to 1:1, but that made me stress out everytime I used my time to take a break, which led to me just throwing the rules away instead of working with them. Instead of making everything time-bound, I'm going to keep the same ratios, and I'm going to instead focus everything on tasks rather than time.
