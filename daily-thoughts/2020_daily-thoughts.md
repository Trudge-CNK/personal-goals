I unintentionally stressed myself out a little by how I arranged my reward structure. I wanted to do either 1:1 or 1:2 work to play ratio according to time, but 1:2 seemed to easy. I changed everything to 1:1, but that made me stress out everytime I used my time to take a break, which led to me just throwing the rules away instead of working with them. Instead of making everything time-bound, I'm going to keep the same ratios, and I'm going to instead focus everything on tasks rather than time.
I also ended up wasting a good bit of time because I havent' figured out how to spend time properly with the puppy. I was planning on tiring him out, but instead he napped on me for like 3 hours which killed my entire morning. Which, of course, lead to the death of the entire rest of the day.

Not a whole bunch to say. I ended up not being able to make a solid transition between work and home (possiby because I wanted to watch the puppy?). Without a smooth transition, I just ended up not really accomplishing anything.

Using task based 1:1 work:play ratios worked pretty well, but I have to be watching that I don't overextend in play so I had to make a list of what counted as a work session vs a play session. I also ended up adding a rule that I should always have an alarm for naps since I took a nap that wasted a good chunk of the afternoon. I was able to keep to pretty much all my smaller todos, but the lost time from the nap killed any chances at larger projects.

I got a good workout since I had to kayak a lot at work, but we ended up messing up so we'll have to have another huge kayak day later. I took a whole bunch of long naps throughout the day and even ended up sleeping somehwere that wasn't my room for the night. I did end up keeping myself to my work:play ratios, but I was kind of running thin on what I counted as work by the end of the day.

This day was pretty decent. I pretty much finished Christmas shopping so I just have to wait for the gifts to come back in. I found some new ways to play with the puppy so that'll keep both of us entertained. The main difference was that I think I finally found something that I can be focused on. Part of it was that I changed my 100 day challenges to 100 hour challenges, which puts lets focus on me being incredibly consistent, and it also allows me to go hog wild on a topic if I so desire. The other change was that I added a bunch of personal "ghosts" for me to race against and improve. I got the idea because I've been playing a kart racer on Switch, and lot of racing games have recordings or "ghosts" of your best times you can race against. I'm in a weird place in life where I'm not the best at anything, so it's nice to be able to race against myself instead of putting my barometer against other people that are really successful or skilled.

This day was pretty good. I didn't make a whole bunch of movement, but I started working in the Learning How to Learn course from Coursera. The other main takeaway was that I got to spend some time with my sister since she needed a ride. She's really enjoying her physical therapy rotation, which is great news. She got hers pretty late in the game, but she ended up with one of the best rotations. Other than that, we just got to hang out for a few hours together. It was nice.

This day was awkward. I had a difficult reading in the morning that threw me off for the entire day. I did start trying to actually improve my skill at a video game vs just running through the story mode so that's actually a big difference for me. Other than that, I mainly just spent time with the puppy so it was relaxing, but I never really hunkered down to recover and be more productive later in the day.

I finished up the second season of the Mandalorian today. It was a fun ride, and I'm curious to see how they move forward with the story. I had some work where we were on a frozen pond. I was the only one really light enough to shuffle across the ice so I got to skate around while everyone else either broke through the ice or just sat on the bank. We weren't successful, but I had a lot of fun. Unfortunatley, I don't have a really good mechanism to switch from fairly unexpected work to a productive afternoon so I wasted some time before I had to carpool my sister since her car is states away. I was glad to be able to help out family, but I didn't really get much done today.

I had a really productive morning, but I haven't figured out a good way to handle Saturday afternoons yet. The puppy has been alone for a while at that point, so I want to spend time with him, but it's a good many hours til my Mom gets home to watch her dog. I usually end up spending hours with the puppy desperately trying to watch decent youtube videos. By the end of it, I'm so emotionally drained that I just take a nap and waste the rest of the day. Hopefully I can make some structural changes to how I go about things so I can actually accomplish some things on Saturday. Other than that, a church near us had a Christmas light drive-through so that was a fun experience. The funniest bit was that, because of lax mask rules there, the sign said "enter at your own risk." The phrase just seemed way to fit for a haunted house and not for a Christmas event...

This day was a boring one. I didn't get much done, but I did hand around family a lot. My sister was running around cleaning stuff up for Mom since she's a bit of a neat freak sometimes. The only thing I really did all day was get back into Yugioh by playing with my Progression Series discord. I ended up getting trashed in all 5 of my matches so that was rough. I guess I have to go back to the drawing board if I'm going to snag any wins. I have been thinking of changing my life focus over to ~100 challenges, whether that's hours or days. I'm not a person who has a whole bunch of passions, but I wouldn't mind being a bit of a Renaissance man and trying out a whole bunch of things to see if anything sticks.

Not proud of today, honestly. I got a lot of my room cleaned up, and I got a haircut, but I didn't really do much else. I always get into situations where I let myself be torn between my current productivity plans and my future productivity plans, pretending that a different approach will be a magic bullet. Hopefully I'll transition to doing 100x challenges(days, hours, times) sometime tomorrow so I can really get back to what I want to focus on.

**12/22/2020**
I finally decided on making some 100x challenges, where the x stands for hours, days, etc. I think that will be my focus from now on. I'll just try to be a slight Renaissance man and see which focuses inspire me as I learn them. Then, my 100 hour challenges can turn into 200 hours, 500 hours, or 1000 hours....

My family also came to visit. It's been our one real risk we've taken during the whole virus since we only have a chance to see them once a year. It was really nice seeing them and especially having them meet the puppy. He was apprehensive at first, but he ended up getting along with everyone really well.

**12/23-24/2020**
I just didn't update anything since I've been spending time with family. Worth it.

Christmas was nice. I got some good button-up tees, everything I need to become a sushi master, and some money for downloadable Switch games.
We had an huge breakfast for what was essentially lunch, and we had a huge dinner with lots of steak and fancy sausages. We played Superfight and Kingdomino with each other so those were some good times. I somehow almost lost a round to meatloaf (the literal food) though....

3 Things really threw me off though. My Yugioh Progression Series Discord that I participate in had a secret santa, and I was the only person out of the whole group so far to be gifted an absolute garbage card. Everyone else got things that could actually go in a deck. It just made me feel like My gifter didn't want me to have a better deck? It also hurt more since I gave my giftee a card that he said that he wanted but was hard to build around. I compensated by giving him more cards from my collection that were rare but not all that powerful. The second thing was that my brother was selling me as some sort of tech guru to his cousin-in-law. This kid had a custom discord bot that he made connected to a raspberry pi that kept a counter for how many Discords his bot was being used in (214!). I've been slowly struggling back and forth to learn the basics of any programming for the past 5-6 years. The whole thing just made me so anxious and so jealous of the kid as well becuase his family seemed so supportive of all his hobbies. His family will watch anime with him, and I've never been made to feel anything but weird for any of my media likes within my own family. It sucks. The third thing was that I absent-mindedly ran our tiny puppy into a metal box while I was playing with him. He recovered eventually, but he whined a bit since it hurt. I just hated myself by the end of the night. We watched a TV show that my brother's friend helped make and win 6 Emmy's for. My friends are unemployed or excited at the idea of killing oter people....so with all that said. Awkward Christmas.
