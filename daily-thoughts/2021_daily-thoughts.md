This day was actually kind of awful. I was focused so much on doing everything right that I let a few mishaps destroy the rest of the day. I realized how important it was to me to have segments of the day that were on autopilot in productive ways and how important it was to have a 1:1 work:life balance that would make obvious decision point for me in the day. Without those decision points, I tend to just careen off into utter laziness. A fun part of my laziness was that I got to watch 2 really good reviews of the abomination that is "Cats" 2019. The one by Sideways is really good since he analizes why the music isn't even that fun in the movie.

I hate being alone house sitting. Something about it just saps all my energy. Basically, 1/2 was a complete wash.
I do have a few things I want to implement, though.
1. I want to start a 100 hour challenge for Reddit and for Youtube so I can see how much they are invading my daily life.
2. I want to focus on failing quickly. I just have to expect to fail but be happy that I'm at least attempting something.

I did actually manage to start a few things today so that was good. The main problem I had was that I also really wanted to find a way to relax for a bit
without it adding onto my reddit or youtube hours. I ended up taking a ~4 hour nap, which I probably needed but which also just drained my motivation for the entire rest of the day.

I had to start a 100 hour challenge for naps as well just as a way to keep track of how much time I'm using on naps compared to my actual goals.

I honestly just skipped journaling for this day on 1/5 so I'm not exactly sure if anything important happened.

Not a great day. I'm house sitting for a good while longer now since my cousin decided he'd stay in Florida for an extra 10 days. It's for business-related reasons so it was much less frustrating once I heard the entire reason. My whole Yugioh server exploded when our beloved meme-lord left. I think it'll be interesting to see if any changes come from it or not. I did change some of my goals to be times or session-based rather than being based on days just becuase I'd like to burn through my goals quicker if possible. If I like the goal, I can always add more sessions onto it anyway. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I feel like I need to find an overarching goal to keep me centered. I just know I can't keep going through the motions.
