This day was actually kind of awful. I was focused so much on doing everything right that I let a few mishaps destroy the rest of the day. I realized how important it was to me to have segments of the day that were on autopilot in productive ways and how important it was to have a 1:1 work:life balance that would make obvious decision point for me in the day. Without those decision points, I tend to just careen off into utter laziness. A fun part of my laziness was that I got to watch 2 really good reviews of the abomination that is "Cats" 2019. The one by Sideways is really good since he analizes why the music isn't even that fun in the movie.

I hate being alone house sitting. Something about it just saps all my energy. Basically, 1/2 was a complete wash.
I do have a few things I want to implement, though.
1. I want to start a 100 hour challenge for Reddit and for Youtube so I can see how much they are invading my daily life.
2. I want to focus on failing quickly. I just have to expect to fail but be happy that I'm at least attempting something.

I did actually manage to start a few things today so that was good. The main problem I had was that I also really wanted to find a way to relax for a bit
without it adding onto my reddit or youtube hours. I ended up taking a ~4 hour nap, which I probably needed but which also just drained my motivation for the entire rest of the day.

I had to start a 100 hour challenge for naps as well just as a way to keep track of how much time I'm using on naps compared to my actual goals.

I honestly just skipped journaling for this day on 1/5 so I'm not exactly sure if anything important happened.

Not a great day. I'm house sitting for a good while longer now since my cousin decided he'd stay in Florida for an extra 10 days. It's for business-related reasons so it was much less frustrating once I heard the entire reason. My whole Yugioh server exploded when our beloved meme-lord left. I think it'll be interesting to see if any changes come from it or not. I did change some of my goals to be times or session-based rather than being based on days just becuase I'd like to burn through my goals quicker if possible. If I like the goal, I can always add more sessions onto it anyway. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I feel like I need to find an overarching goal to keep me centered. I just know I can't keep going through the motions.

Not too much to say for this day. I did manage to get some salt for the driveway so that should help a lot traction wise. The first snow of the year was also freezing rain. Not a great combination. A podcast I was listening to sugggested that while grit and persistence are vital for any sort of success, it's also really important to design your life so that your lazy options are also your most productive options. I did catch up with my weekly watch-through of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. It's been a pretty funny show so far, but it does lean into being pervy which anime unfortunately tends to do...
Other than that, a pretty lackluster day. I think I need to make habits so I can start my 100X challenges at certain times or segments of the day.

Nothing really of consequence to write home about.

I had a good chunk of ideas to carry out on the 11th, but I really lost track of the day after I came back from a work outing. I think I've managed to get around 10 days of ~20 minutes devotions in so that's really nice that something good is in my 10% finished category for my 100X challenges.Other than that, I don't really have a lot to say for the day except that I plan on making a food philosophy so that I don't spend the rest of my life guzzling down fast food and sugar.

This day went a bit better. There's something that really works for me where I can start a music playlist and make then make a good decision soon after. I think it might have something to do with how video content is enough to immerse me, while music isn't quite enough to make time disappear. I'm happy to be trying to play more music in the background to help me with my decisions. I made a philosophy of how I approach food, which is probably good since I'm in my 30s. I'm mainly trying to turn food into something I use for experience and for health rather than as a way to drown out or amplify how I feel for the day. Other than that, I tried to recalibrate my overall goal to be one where I try to inspire other people to learn. It might be silly, but My Hero Academia is such an inspirining show, they just hit all the emotional bits really well. It inspired me to at least have some goal to work towards since I'm usually too worried about failing to even pursue goals. I still have trouble doing things after dinner. I'm thinking that I should save activities that don't require a lot of note taking for after dinner. That way, I can still be productive without having to type a bunch of random things at the end of the day.

**1/13/2021**
I had a pretty good day. I got a good chunk of hours into my study of Yugioh's goat format such that I'm actually close to 10 hours in that goal. I still haven't made a really good trigger for changing over to something productive after lunch. I ended up eating lunch, napping a bit, and then piddling around till I was bored enough to start studying. I didn't do the worst after dinner, but at least my time was taken up by interesting youtube videos and online discussions rather than by random videos to kill time.

**1/14/2021**
I was actually really proud of today. I didn't have anything random in the middle of the day to throw me off so I was able to get a good rhythm going on some of my 100X challenges. I did tail off toward the end of the day though so I need to figure out how to reset better. I'm planning on sticking to a healthier food philosophy as a challenge since I can go on fast food binges sometimes. I want to add a challenge where I alternate between 100X challenges and regular todos since I have to balance improving myself and keeping my life stabilized. I really enjoyed having a good run with my 100X challenge yesterday, but I really skimped out on doing any todos that might have been on my list.

I'm finally done house sitting so that's nice that I can finally get back to my normal home life. Bad news for the day was that the shrimp at the Italian place I got takeout from wrecked my bowels. The other person I ate with was fine so that was a huge relief. It was her birthday so I'd rather me have issues than her. I didn't really get much done, but it was mostly because it was someone's birthday so I'm kind of ok with a slow day.

I was about as productive as usual on Saturday's, which, unfortunately, is not very productive at all. I tend to have a lot of trouble watcing the puppy and also being productive. Once I've binged youtube for a while (since a lot of channels realease their content on Saturday), I'm kinda stuck in a lazy loop. I got so lazy I don't even really want to play the Yugioh tournaments that I participate in on the weekends. 1/17 Should be a little bit better because I don't have to watch the dog, though. I learned that Chipotle tastes good but looks awful when you order the cheese and corn but forgo lettuce. Instead of looking bright and refreshing, everything is just....yellow.

**1/18/2021**
Wow today was bad. I got demotivated a lot during my devotions so I ended up spending the first half of my day doing nothing except youtube and reddit. I then took a nap where I slept passed lunch and finally got to watch the newest episode of the Yugioh Progession series. I twiddled my thumbs some more until I decided that the only goal in life I can really pursue is breaking up my day with Spotify. There's something about the level of entertainment music gives me that actually stops me dead in my tracks and lets me refocus on what I actually want to do. I'm entertained enough by videos or reading where I can just keep drowning in a never ending whirlpool. Now spotify as my main life goal doesn't send me in any particular directions, but I'd much rather be doing something than doing nothing at all.

**1/19/2021**
Today was actually fairly productive. I mainly got a lot of todos done, but that's not so bad. The big time save that I came up with is that I'm under no obligation to catch up to a show I'm following daily. If I slip and don't watch an episode for a bit, I then have to make up for 2-3 hours of content of just watching TV. At my age, I don't need lapsed TV shows to take up possible productive time.

I spent a lot of the day freaking out becuase I realized that I was going to end the winter without having any "signature" accomplishment. I guess it hurt a lot becuase I have way more time in the winter so any big productive moves have to happen during thise months. The panic and disappointment kept me from doing anything productive til about 1, but, in the end, I decided to just continue doing what I've been doing. If I can't slowly achieve things like I set out to do, I'll never achieve anything. That's the whole point of trudging along.

I realized that, while I set my goal as learning 100 hours of Yugioh, I don't really have the faith that 100 hours of study will make me competitive in any real sense. I'm also afraid of losing time to a "children's card game". One part of me feels that thinking this makes me more mature, but it also continues my inability to do anything in my life for a long period of time.
My Yugioh Solution at the time was that I need to be actually playing matches regularly and talking to people to see how much I'm improving rather than keeping everything theoretical until I finish my 100 hours.
I added a planned Spotify break in the morning so I wouldn't tail off into youtube and random sitcoms.

I got really thrown off yesterday becuase of a question at small group that was something like, "What one dream do you have would be difficult to give up if God asked you to? (referrring to how Abraham readily trusted God in the whole Isaac sacrifice thing). The thing that bothered me was that I didn't have any dream. There's nothing that I'm willing to go afte with 100% of my energy and there never really has been. That was tough to deal with, but eventually I had to reset and realize that the only thing I can really do is see what I have currently and try to rule over my sphere of influence like I've been asked to. I got inspired by the parable to the talents too that even if I only am given 1/100 of a talent, I should at least try to make it into 1/50 of a talent.
After that realization, I mostly ended up doing todos since I had a dog gate to put up and dinner to make. Hopefully a new perspective will help me reach out in new directions more consistently.

I've just been really off for the past few days. I couldn't really get myself to even start anything because I do have a big mental block when it comes to thinking about big, overll goals. One one hand, I don't want my entire life to be a waste, but on the other, I don't realy trust myself enough to be successful where I can confidently follow any sort of large dream. I did listen to a Dr. Nerdlove podcast where there was a lady talking about re-patterning. The insight that I really liked was that when you're making positive affirmations, don't make them ones that you don't believe yourself. Even if it's not phenominal, if you believe it, you can more easily make progress. I tried to add some things so I'm more consistent in my 100x challenges, but the main thing that I added was a simple loop of Spotify to be able to focus, choosing what I'm doing next, and then returning right to Spotify to thinkn about the next step. Hopefully, I'll accomplish a lot of cool things, but my only real goal is to keep looping every day.
