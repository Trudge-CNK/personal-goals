This day was actually kind of awful. I was focused so much on doing everything right that I let a few mishaps destroy the rest of the day. I realized how important it was to me to have segments of the day that were on autopilot in productive ways and how important it was to have a 1:1 work:life balance that would make obvious decision point for me in the day. Without those decision points, I tend to just careen off into utter laziness. A fun part of my laziness was that I got to watch 2 really good reviews of the abomination that is "Cats" 2019. The one by Sideways is really good since he analizes why the music isn't even that fun in the movie.

I hate being alone house sitting. Something about it just saps all my energy. Basically, 1/2 was a complete wash.
I do have a few things I want to implement, though.
1. I want to start a 100 hour challenge for Reddit and for Youtube so I can see how much they are invading my daily life.
2. I want to focus on failing quickly. I just have to expect to fail but be happy that I'm at least attempting something.

**1/3/2021**

I did actually manage to start a few things today so that was good. The main problem I had was that I also really wanted to find a way to relax for a bit
without it adding onto my reddit or youtube hours. I ended up taking a ~4 hour nap, which I probably needed but which also just drained my motivation for the entire rest of the day.

I had to start a 100 hour challenge for naps as well just as a way to keep track of how much time I'm using on naps compared to my actual goals.

I honestly just skipped journaling for this day on 1/5 so I'm not exactly sure if anything important happened.

Not a great day. I'm house sitting for a good while longer now since my cousin decided he'd stay in Florida for an extra 10 days. It's for business-related reasons so it was much less frustrating once I heard the entire reason. My whole Yugioh server exploded when our beloved meme-lord left. I think it'll be interesting to see if any changes come from it or not. I did change some of my goals to be times or session-based rather than being based on days just becuase I'd like to burn through my goals quicker if possible. If I like the goal, I can always add more sessions onto it anyway. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I feel like I need to find an overarching goal to keep me centered. I just know I can't keep going through the motions.

Not too much to say for this day. I did manage to get some salt for the driveway so that should help a lot traction wise. The first snow of the year was also freezing rain. Not a great combination. A podcast I was listening to sugggested that while grit and persistence are vital for any sort of success, it's also really important to design your life so that your lazy options are also your most productive options. I did catch up with my weekly watch-through of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. It's been a pretty funny show so far, but it does lean into being pervy which anime unfortunately tends to do...
Other than that, a pretty lackluster day. I think I need to make habits so I can start my 100X challenges at certain times or segments of the day.

Nothing really of consequence to write home about.

**1/11/2021**
I had a good chunk of ideas to carry out on the 11th, but I really lost track of the day after I came back from a work outing. I think I've managed to get around 10 days of ~20 minutes devotions in so that's really nice that something good is in my 10% finished category for my 100X challenges.Other than that, I don't really have a lot to say for the day except that I plan on making a food philosophy so that I don't spend the rest of my life guzzling down fast food and sugar.

**1/12/2021**
This day went a bit better. There's something that really works for me where I can start a music playlist and make then make a good decision soon after. I think it might have something to do with how video content is enough to immerse me, while music isn't quite enough to make time disappear. I'm happy to be trying to play more music in the background to help me with my decisions. I made a philosophy of how I approach food, which is probably good since I'm in my 30s. I'm mainly trying to turn food into something I use for experience and for health rather than as a way to drown out or amplify how I feel for the day. Other than that, I tried to recalibrate my overall goal to be one where I try to inspire other people to learn. It might be silly, but My Hero Academia is such an inspirining show, they just hit all the emotional bits really well. It inspired me to at least have some goal to work towards since I'm usually too worried about failing to even pursue goals. I still have trouble doing things after dinner. I'm thinking that I should save activities that don't require a lot of note taking for after dinner. That way, I can still be productive without having to type a bunch of random things at the end of the day.

**1/13/2021**
I had a pretty good day. I got a good chunk of hours into my study of Yugioh's goat format such that I'm actually close to 10 hours in that goal. I still haven't made a really good trigger for changing over to something productive after lunch. I ended up eating lunch, napping a bit, and then piddling around till I was bored enough to start studying. I didn't do the worst after dinner, but at least my time was taken up by interesting youtube videos and online discussions rather than by random videos to kill time.

**1/14/2021**
I was actually really proud of today. I didn't have anything random in the middle of the day to throw me off so I was able to get a good rhythm going on some of my 100X challenges. I did tail off toward the end of the day though so I need to figure out how to reset better. I'm planning on sticking to a healthier food philosophy as a challenge since I can go on fast food binges sometimes. I want to add a challenge where I alternate between 100X challenges and regular todos since I have to balance improving myself and keeping my life stabilized. I really enjoyed having a good run with my 100X challenge yesterday, but I really skimped out on doing any todos that might have been on my list.

**1/15/2021**
I'm finally done house sitting so that's nice that I can finally get back to my normal home life. Bad news for the day was that the shrimp at the Italian place I got takeout from wrecked my bowels. The other person I ate with was fine so that was a huge relief. It was her birthday so I'd rather me have issues than her. I didn't really get much done, but it was mostly because it was someone's birthday so I'm kind of ok with a slow day.

I was about as productive as usual on Saturday's, which, unfortunately, is not very productive at all. I tend to have a lot of trouble watcing the puppy and also being productive. Once I've binged youtube for a while (since a lot of channels realease their content on Saturday), I'm kinda stuck in a lazy loop. I got so lazy I don't even really want to play the Yugioh tournaments that I participate in on the weekends. 1/17 Should be a little bit better because I don't have to watch the dog, though. I learned that Chipotle tastes good but looks awful when you order the cheese and corn but forgo lettuce. Instead of looking bright and refreshing, everything is just....yellow.

**1/18/2021**
Wow today was bad. I got demotivated a lot during my devotions so I ended up spending the first half of my day doing nothing except youtube and reddit. I then took a nap where I slept passed lunch and finally got to watch the newest episode of the Yugioh Progession series. I twiddled my thumbs some more until I decided that the only goal in life I can really pursue is breaking up my day with Spotify. There's something about the level of entertainment music gives me that actually stops me dead in my tracks and lets me refocus on what I actually want to do. I'm entertained enough by videos or reading where I can just keep drowning in a never ending whirlpool. Now spotify as my main life goal doesn't send me in any particular directions, but I'd much rather be doing something than doing nothing at all.

**1/19/2021**
Today was actually fairly productive. I mainly got a lot of todos done, but that's not so bad. The big time save that I came up with is that I'm under no obligation to catch up to a show I'm following daily. If I slip and don't watch an episode for a bit, I then have to make up for 2-3 hours of content of just watching TV. At my age, I don't need lapsed TV shows to take up possible productive time. 

**1/20/2021**

I spent a lot of the day freaking out becuase I realized that I was going to end the winter without having any "signature" accomplishment. I guess it hurt a lot becuase I have way more time in the winter so any big productive moves have to happen during thise months. The panic and disappointment kept me from doing anything productive til about 1, but, in the end, I decided to just continue doing what I've been doing. If I can't slowly achieve things like I set out to do, I'll never achieve anything. That's the whole point of trudging along.

**1/21/2021**

I realized that, while I set my goal as learning 100 hours of Yugioh, I don't really have the faith that 100 hours of study will make me competitive in any real sense. I'm also afraid of losing time to a "children's card game". One part of me feels that thinking this makes me more mature, but it also continues my inability to do anything in my life for a long period of time.
My Yugioh Solution at the time was that I need to be actually playing matches regularly and talking to people to see how much I'm improving rather than keeping everything theoretical until I finish my 100 hours.
I added a planned Spotify break in the morning so I wouldn't tail off into youtube and random sitcoms.

**1/22/2021**

I got really thrown off yesterday becuase of a question at small group that was something like, "What one dream do you have would be difficult to give up if God asked you to? (referrring to how Abraham readily trusted God in the whole Isaac sacrifice thing). The thing that bothered me was that I didn't have any dream. There's nothing that I'm willing to go afte with 100% of my energy and there never really has been. That was tough to deal with, but eventually I had to reset and realize that the only thing I can really do is see what I have currently and try to rule over my sphere of influence like I've been asked to. I got inspired by the parable to the talents too that even if I only am given 1/100 of a talent, I should at least try to make it into 1/50 of a talent.
After that realization, I mostly ended up doing todos since I had a dog gate to put up and dinner to make. Hopefully a new perspective will help me reach out in new directions more consistently.

I've just been really off for the past few days. I couldn't really get myself to even start anything because I do have a big mental block when it comes to thinking about big, overll goals. One one hand, I don't want my entire life to be a waste, but on the other, I don't realy trust myself enough to be successful where I can confidently follow any sort of large dream. I did listen to a Dr. Nerdlove podcast where there was a lady talking about re-patterning. The insight that I really liked was that when you're making positive affirmations, don't make them ones that you don't believe yourself. Even if it's not phenominal, if you believe it, you can more easily make progress. I tried to add some things so I'm more consistent in my 100x challenges, but the main thing that I added was a simple loop of Spotify to be able to focus, choosing what I'm doing next, and then returning right to Spotify to thinkn about the next step. Hopefully, I'll accomplish a lot of cool things, but my only real goal is to keep looping every day.

**1/30/2021**

I can't say for sure I've had a few breakthroughs, but I've had a couple things that I've changed around in my life. The first things I ended up changing was switching up my priorities a bit. Reflexively, if I didn't maintain all my good habits in a day, I'd consider the day lost and then just lie around for the rest of the day in my sorrow. My new plan is to remind myself that if I can't maintain, I can always gain. This has been really helpful because something good can actually come out of each day rather than me focusing on having absolutely perfect habits.

The other main change was a perspective that actually makes me want to pursue things, at least for now. I've tried a lot of angles to motivate me, but I don't really care much about what I'm doing enough to passionately follow something. I've done my new suggestion before, but in a more macro sense rather than on  a day-to-day level. I've thought before, "What things should I grow in so I can be a good father?" I made a list, and I placed it in my wallet, but it didn't stick. My new plan that actually hits me somewhere deep inside is to ask myself if I'd want my son to live like me. For some reason, that is weirdly motivating even though I've never really seen myself as responsible/worthy enough for kids. Basically, a lot of my habits or ways of living are things that I definitely would not want my children to emulate. I have no idea if it will make a lasting change, but for right now, it's weirdly motivating.

I also think I want to simplify all my challenges a bit since keeping track of all this, especially once I start going back to my longer work weeks, is going to be unweildy.

**2/13/2021**
I haven't updated in a while so let's see what I can manage. February started out really well since I knew what was happening with my work situation, and I could plan my days easily. Unfortunately, I got called in to cover for another worker for ~5 days so that really threw off the amazing schedule that I was on. I've had a few other random days where I was required to do surprise work shifts so I just have to roll a bit with all these punches just when I've finally managed to get a decent pattern going. I feel like that always happens in my life though. I manage to finally get just a bit of momentum, and that is when a bunch of random todos or obligations get thrust on me so that I have to add a bunch of difficulties onto my shaky bedrock. One main change was that I got rid of Yugioh as one of my main goals. I felt that it would be a lot simpler to focus on 2 main things at a time (and maybe complete them quicker) rather than having to juggle 3 things and never really end up getting to the one that I consider most important because I'm focusing all my time on the other 2 tasks.

Sunday was a weird day because I always see it as the end of my week. I ended up just wasting the day because of that feeling. It also didn't help that I tend to have trouble recovering in the afternoon if I eat fast food, and I had Popeye's. A lazy Sunday led to me sleeping in and wasting the entire day on Monday. I took the end of Monday to replan a little bit so I had alarms for each and every day of the week. If I don't have a structured way to wake up in the morning, I tend to fall apart. I also just spent a lot of time over the weekend desperately trying to catch up to WandaVision after I had finished up with Queen's Gambit. I'm all caught up now, but I think I'm going to try to avoid currently-airing shows in the future so I don't feel pressured to catch up with the newest episode. Overall, not very good days at all, but I have some new boundaries which I'm a fan of. I also ended up falling down the classic rabbit hole of seeing how Wonderbred he-man has been doing. It's a toy-collecting mystery that Masters of the Universe fans have been pondering for online since 2002. It's ridiculous and insane and kind of impressive.

**2/17/2021**

2/16 was actually a decently productive day so there weren't any really interesting notes about it. I didn't get everything done, but that was likely because I had a decent chunk of things to catch up on. As for 2/17, I started out fine, but I really hit a road block when I started to think how I wanted to deal with avoiding our puppy a little bit so I could be productive. He's adorable, but he's very needy so you can't really show your face to him unless you want to spend the next couple hours with him. There was no simple solution so I decided I had to use noise-reducing earbuds and planned time with him to solve the problem. Otherwise, I'll never be able to study or do the things that I absolutely need to do. That difficult choice messed me up for the day for some reason so I was pretty much a lazy bum, which I'm disappointed at. I did end up changing things a little bit, though. I noticed that I usually try to blitz through my media for the day as fast as possible so I made sure to hide those todos a little bit. I can still watch and take notes on what I'm consuming, but my important goals are now more front-and-center than before. I went to bed feeling a lot of hatred toward myself because a family acquaintance had their son going to a Division 1 school. I've just messed up or not seen the chances that I have gotten so it just hurt to see someone shining so brightly. I have to remember that I can only keep pace or benchmark myself to myself. I've messed up too much to really compare myself to other people, but I never want to be the person I've been for years.

**2/18/2021**
The main change I made was that I wanted to focus more on exerting myself during my exercise. I'm not working out crazy hard since all I'm doing is aerobics and an exercise bike while simultaneously watching TV. I did adjust it so I'm at max tension, and I sprint during commericals.
Other than that, it was a pretty good day. I kept productive throughout the day mostly, although I slipped a bit in the middle of the day. I still ended up consuming entertainment in a healthy way, but I made sure to adjust things by focusing on the harder things in the morning. If I don't, I don't end up with enough willpower to do the tough things at the end of the day.

**2/19/2021**

I ended up adding daily counters for my hourly goals so that I could update them on Twitter, etc. daily instead of forgetting to update people on them.
Other than that, I had a decently productive day. I didn't get more than 1 hour of each of my main goals, but that's all that I've set out to do so I don't want to get mad at myself for that. I ended up finishing Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze so that was nice. It was a pretty good platformer altogether, but I'll probably either "fix" my pro controller d-pad or swap to the joycons next time I play for completion so that I have a bit more control (the d-pad registers to many diagonal presses when obviously pressed down). Other than that, I got a few easy todos off of my list, but I managed to mess up on finishing my planned todos for the day.

**2/22/2021**
---
Blech. Things have not been going well for the past few days. I realized that I still have a pretty big blindspot when it comes to weekends and certain workdays. I mentally have weekends in a "relax" category so I end up wasting them, and I have a hard time swapping after work because my first and most important task is to take care of the dog until it's owner comes back. Unfortunatley, watching an energetic puppy for ~2 hours while being forced to half-watch youtube is weirdly one of the most draining activities of my day. I think I need to find a good way to snap back into control after the time with the puppy. I also might have stumbled a bit because I started letting the world know my productivity goals. There's something about letting people know about my goals that makes me instantly fail them and then feel crappy enough that it takes days to recover. On the other hand, I feel that if I don't share what's happening in my life, I'll never really connect with people. 
One thing I'm experimenting with is trying to use todoist instead of Microsoft todo. It has some things that I like, but others I'm not a fan of. I think the biggest reason for the change was so I could force my most important tasks to the top of the list. Otherwise, I end up completing a lot of smaller todos that aren't really that important.

**I was a bit crushed today. I learned that the web developer boot camp that I have paid access to was closing down the original version of their program(they did give me a pdf of the program as consolation.) It was an amazing opportunity that I threw away for over 5 years. It not only taught software development, but also gave access to educational services and a work network to help the students land jobs. Their success rate was around 84% for jobs. I'm not even really sure what always held me back. Somehow, I didn't think I was good enough to participate in it with other people, that I wouldn't be able to make the grade once I did projects or activities that weren't just multiple choice like I had in a lot of high school and college. 
I was able to get into the program because it was the first online cohort. I don't think I'd be able to make the cut today. If I had to say anything, there's part of me that's a little glad that it's gone because it always this amazing backup plan for whenever I finally got my life together.
It's sad, but I'm at absolute ground 0 for my career. My degree is 7 years old, and I'm completely rusty if not completely clueless on those skills nowadays. The only job I've ever managed to get is one directly connected to nepotism. I won't lie, I'm a solid worker, but there's always been something that's kept me back from interfacing with the world. I have a few more guesses nowadays than when I was younger, but that doesn't fix the problem. I guess my future is free now, but what am I free to do? I think this is a big point in my life, one where I have to state out my larger goals.**
---
**1. Complete some sort of free programming bootcamp so that my future nieces and nephews can have a head start
  2. Consistently learn other academic subjects 100 hours at a time so I can help tutor those who need it
**3. Keep my life vibrant by trying out different hobbies for 33 hours each**

**2/25/2021**
I really messed up on the 25th. I thought I had a good morning plan, but I forgot that I had my iOS alarm set to absolute silence. I woke up late which let to me just having a really lay day where nothing got done. I did end up setting up sounds for all my alarms, and I have a reset plan for any day in which I start to wander off into sad-binging content so I hope those work out to some degree.

The 24th was actually pretty good though. I got a lot of todos done, and I managed to clock 3.5 hours in Crash Team Racing to close the gap to finishing one of my hourly goals by half. I don't have the breadth of focus that I'd like yet, but I'm glad that I was able to push so hard for at least one of my hourly goals.

**2/26/2021**
---
This day went fine. I made progress in a good amount of things. I didn't do perfectly, but I'm certainly not disappointed with myself. My biggest achievement was that I worked on Crash Team Racing Nitro-fueled for another 3.5 Hours on the 26th so that I could finish the first of my 33-Hour projects. Overall, I was a little bit disappointed with my choice to focus so hard on a game that none of my friends have, but the positive was that I finally got to see myself improve at something over a decently long length of time. Not that I was ever diagnosed as a "gifted" kid, but I was the "smartest" student in a really tiny school so I always thought that I had to know everything from the start. CTR proves that even if I start at a really average skill level, I can just take my time and eventually reach a fairly highly-skilled level (I almost beat all the Velo times, but I dont' even want to bother with the Dev times. Those are for the real hardcore gamers).

**2/28/2021**
I ended the month with kind of a flop. A day or two I wasted because something that was supposed to happen in the future was put on wobbly ground. Praise the Lord because a few things came through, and now everything looks like it's back on track.
I also just spent a lot of time throwing some ideas against the wall because my workflow changes a lot once spring comes around. I think I was able to make some good changes, but we'll have to see.

**3/21/2021**
---
Yikes. I have been really struggling with juggling my increased work hours for the spring with being productive in all the ways I have planned. I have maybe one session of learning through the entire month so far. It's not good. 
One really great thing is that I'm finall going to be able to get my own place to rent in a few months. That's going to be nice because I'll be able to free myself a bit and have some options rather than being tied down to supporting other family members. I'm also just super happy that the family member that I like to think I've been helping will have a new focus in their life.
Yesterday in particular was awful. I was just really hating myself throughout the entire day. The main reasons was that I kept going over how no one I know in real life has many similarities to me. I just always feel like there's a huge void between me and other people because of our interests/thought processes/political differences. I'm really tired of feeling like some stitched-together frankenstein of a person when everyone else seems so harmonious. I'm just so tired that no one can every know the real me because I'm afraid it would ruin every relationshiop I have.
I know this isn't the healthiest plan, but I think it's the only one I have available because of my current situation of needing to rely on others and not currently having the deep work skills needed to support myself on my own. **I'm going to start removing bits and pieces of the things that I hold dear (but are different), and I'll start to add on everything that will start gluing me to the people that are actually around me.** Will it actually change me? Who the heck knows, but I hope that it will put a fire underneath me so that I can eventually reach some sort of personal freedom through hard work and learning.
