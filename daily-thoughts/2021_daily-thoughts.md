This day was actually kind of awful. I was focused so much on doing everything right that I let a few mishaps destroy the rest of the day. I realized how important it was to me to have segments of the day that were on autopilot in productive ways and how important it was to have a 1:1 work:life balance that would make obvious decision point for me in the day. Without those decision points, I tend to just careen off into utter laziness. A fun part of my laziness was that I got to watch 2 really good reviews of the abomination that is "Cats" 2019. The one by Sideways is really good since he analizes why the music isn't even that fun in the movie.

I hate being alone house sitting. Something about it just saps all my energy. Basically, 1/2 was a complete wash.
I do have a few things I want to implement, though.
1. I want to start a 100 hour challenge for Reddit and for Youtube so I can see how much they are invading my daily life.
2. I want to focus on failing quickly. I just have to expect to fail but be happy that I'm at least attempting something.

I did actually manage to start a few things today so that was good. The main problem I had was that I also really wanted to find a way to relax for a bit
without it adding onto my reddit or youtube hours. I ended up taking a ~4 hour nap, which I probably needed but which also just drained my motivation for the entire rest of the day.

I had to start a 100 hour challenge for naps as well just as a way to keep track of how much time I'm using on naps compared to my actual goals.

I honestly just skipped journaling for this day on 1/5 so I'm not exactly sure if anything important happened.

Not a great day. I'm house sitting for a good while longer now since my cousin decided he'd stay in Florida for an extra 10 days. It's for business-related reasons so it was much less frustrating once I heard the entire reason. My whole Yugioh server exploded when our beloved meme-lord left. I think it'll be interesting to see if any changes come from it or not. I did change some of my goals to be times or session-based rather than being based on days just becuase I'd like to burn through my goals quicker if possible. If I like the goal, I can always add more sessions onto it anyway. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I feel like I need to find an overarching goal to keep me centered. I just know I can't keep going through the motions.

Not too much to say for this day. I did manage to get some salt for the driveway so that should help a lot traction wise. The first snow of the year was also freezing rain. Not a great combination. A podcast I was listening to sugggested that while grit and persistence are vital for any sort of success, it's also really important to design your life so that your lazy options are also your most productive options. I did catch up with my weekly watch-through of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. It's been a pretty funny show so far, but it does lean into being pervy which anime unfortunately tends to do...
Other than that, a pretty lackluster day. I think I need to make habits so I can start my 100X challenges at certain times or segments of the day.

Nothing really of consequence to write home about.

I had a good chunk of ideas to carry out on the 11th, but I really lost track of the day after I came back from a work outing. I think I've managed to get around 10 days of ~20 minutes devotions in so that's really nice that something good is in my 10% finished category for my 100X challenges.Other than that, I don't really have a lot to say for the day except that I plan on making a food philosophy so that I don't spend the rest of my life guzzling down fast food and sugar.

This day went a bit better. There's something that really works for me where I can start a music playlist and make then make a good decision soon after. I think it might have something to do with how video content is enough to immerse me, while music isn't quite enough to make time disappear. I'm happy to be trying to play more music in the background to help me with my decisions. I made a philosophy of how I approach food, which is probably good since I'm in my 30s. I'm mainly trying to turn food into something I use for experience and for health rather than as a way to drown out or amplify how I feel for the day. Other than that, I tried to recalibrate my overall goal to be one where I try to inspire other people to learn. It might be silly, but My Hero Academia is such an inspirining show, they just hit all the emotional bits really well. It inspired me to at least have some goal to work towards since I'm usually too worried about failing to even pursue goals. I still have trouble doing things after dinner. I'm thinking that I should save activities that don't require a lot of note taking for after dinner. That way, I can still be productive without having to type a bunch of random things at the end of the day.
