This day was actually kind of awful. I was focused so much on doing everything right that I let a few mishaps destroy the rest of the day. I realized how important it was to me to have segments of the day that were on autopilot in productive ways and how important it was to have a 1:1 work:life balance that would make obvious decision point for me in the day. Without those decision points, I tend to just careen off into utter laziness. A fun part of my laziness was that I got to watch 2 really good reviews of the abomination that is "Cats" 2019. The one by Sideways is really good since he analizes why the music isn't even that fun in the movie.
